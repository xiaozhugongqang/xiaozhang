7239826678	positive	7239826678.jpg	clare , suffolk . dated 1473 , a pargetting tour de force . pargetting is the art of external decorated plasterwork and although it is not exclusive to suffolk it was practised here with enthusiasm from the late tudor period right up until world war one . with the wattle and daub method of construction ( pargetting being suitable only for a lathed and timbered backing ) the craft became an important and integral part of the building trade until bricks became more freely available . the pargetter would press the moulds of wet plaster ( usually a mixture of slaked lime , sand , hair and the inevitable secret ingredient , known only to individual craftsmen ) to the house exterior until it was fixed . pargetting patterns came in a variety of forms including friezes ( using ribbons of chevrons , scallops , fantails or dots ) , overall frames enclosing motifs , geometrical or floral designs , and coats of arms . the popularity for pargetting in suffolk is often attributed to the plasterers who arrived here from the low countries and many of the parget themes are similar to those fashioned by flemish craftsmen .	house
