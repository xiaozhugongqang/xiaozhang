Just enjoying a fine cup of Earl Grey and some local reading before it starts. I love this studio and the smell as you walk in üå∫ it always brings on a gorgeous calming affect. I had to giggle I got asked if I was a teacher when I ordered my tea - it‚Äôs a sign from the universe clearly ‚ò∫Ô∏è as I have signed up for a 22 day yoga teacher training course in Lombok towards the end of the year üôè the intention isn‚Äôt to become a teacher as such, just improve my own practice and learn something new, hey who knows though? Maybe I will end up doing some teaching. If I do, the music will be good that‚Äôs for sure üé∂üíØ‚ù§Ô∏èü§òü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄ? (at triyoga)

60402	Calm	60402.jpg	Good Evening üíö. Happy Tincture Tuesday. There are so many different companies and products on the market at it can be overwhelming to find the one for you. This is one of my favorite tincture companies The woman that owns it is actually a botanist out of Humboldt County. She infuses her products with different natural herbs to make her tinctures even more effective. She also has a line called Sweet Jane which is a CBD rich oil with ratios starting at 20:1 8:1, 4:1, 1:1 and straight THC. They will actually be holding a Demo Day tomorrow from 4-7pm at my work in Carmelüíö I will be there all day. Come by and check them out. I‚Äôm currently take the Calm Tincture. It‚Äôs a 3:1 ratio with 188mg CBD, 62mg THC 1 dropperful=6.2mg CBD, 2.1mg THC 1 drop=0.21mg CBD, 0.07mg THC One of the great things about tinctures is the ability to manage your dose right down to the tenth of a milligram that way you can really truly get just what you need and nothing more. Cannabis care is not like traditional medicine it‚Äôs not take one baby aspirin three times a day. People are treated like the individuals they are, and approaching care with cannabis is always on a more individual level. After my 10yr told me in the sweetest way that she was so proud of me for starting my own business but that I was kinda gnarly now. (Basically she was like mom you‚Äôre like of being a Bitch?lol) So I recently readjusted my dosage and with great feedback from the kid she noted that I haven‚Äôt freaked out, unnecessarily sinceüòâ.

74893	Fear	74893.jpg	Fibro?Fear? Frustration! When you live with chronic illness there is always fear. There is fear that you‚Äôll get worse, fear that you‚Äôll be in such terrible pain forever, fear that you won‚Äôt be able to do this or that, there is always fear associated with a chronic illness. It is a fear that is difficult to explain to someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced a similar illness but it is very real. It is so easy for it to be so much more than this though. New pains bring new concerns. Symptoms that we cannot explain or have not had in the past make us wonder what more we might have to endure. And then when our doctor or doctors can‚Äôt find an answer for us that makes sense our fear often turns to panic and frustration. Read the whole article here

83592	Fear	83592.jpg	I‚Äôm usually excited AF person. I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs a mixture of passion, brilliance, nerdiness ü§ì and obsession. But that excitement energy is rooted in my personality because I‚Äôm constantly anticipating life‚Äôs greatest pleasures. I‚Äôve imagined most of what I want in my head and in my reality day by day, moment by moment I build upon that feeling and vision. That is one of the secrets of getting empowered and having more energy, by visualizing the best life you can live. When I get bad day. I remember why I do what I do. I think about what makes me feel good. And that anticipation of life future pleasure ahead makes all the bad days worth it. What are your goals? What do you envision for you and your family? What would it be like to live out your dreams? What do you look forward to? What are you creating right now to get there? Today I invite you to replace worry and anxiety with a thought about what makes you happy. Whatever it is. Dream body, dream partner, dream career, traveling, etc. Then visualize that thought and feeling for about 10 min everyday for 30 days. And see what happens to your life. I have designed 6 powerful, life changing Empowerment coaching session package. And you get to try the first session free!! Email me for more information.

139495	Love	139495.jpg	I had such a lovely weekend I just wanted to write it down. <!-- more --> I told my boyfriend on Wednesday that I wanted to take him on a date Friday night - we planned for a dinner at one of our fav vegan restaurants and then seeing Free Solo afterwards. Friday night rolls around and he and I both were feeling pretty run down after the week we had, so we stayed in. I ended up coming over with a bottle of wine already wearing my pajamas with my heating pad in tow for the neck pain he was having. We cuddled up on the couch and he ordered us vegetable fried rice and we watched Moon on Netflix. Such a simple evening but it was so so nice and cozy with the rain and chill outside and the warmth and love inside. (Was that? like?way too cheesy? lol) I woke up before him and got my stuff around to go home and go on a run because I skipped it Friday night. Easy 3.5 miles in the rain and wind on super tired muscles. One of those runs that you‚Äôre immediately over before it even starts - I just needed 35 minutes on my feet and I got it, but I did not enjoy it! lol But sometimes that‚Äôs how it goes. Run and done. Ate yummy breakfast with hot delicious coffee & showered. Then I got all nice to go out with my boyfriend! I don‚Äôt wear makeup to work so getting ready to go out on the weekends is always a treat for me to spend some extra time on myself. I drove my boyfriend and I to the pot store up the street and we each got some CBD oil. (Finally got some of my own, I was just using his every now and then but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve got my own now!) Then we went to the camera store downtown where we bought film for our cameras! We got three rolls each. He checked out some more equipment then we were off to the restaurant for dinner. We got there right at five when they opened for dinner and we were the only ones in there for maybe ten minutes then it filled up pretty quickly and we were surrounded by other couples and families. We ordered an appetizer and it was SO delicious! It was some kind of red lentil pecan pate and oh my goodness!! Then we got our dinners - he got a Mexican-inspired dish and I got a portobello wellington plate and we were both pleased as punch. I was so full but when the waitress brought the dessert menu we couldn‚Äôt help but look?and then ordered the plum quince crisp with vegan vanilla ice cream. So. Good. We left the restaurant and tried to make our movie, but it was sold out when we got there! We were both a bit disappointed but we arranged to see it another time this week. I drove us back to my apartment and we fed Joe and hung out with him for a bit, gave him lots of scratches and pets, then grabbed another bottle of wine and some frozen waffles for the morning and went back to his place. (He‚Äôs allergic to cats. *cue tears* lol) We got into our jammies and while he watched the last two episodes of House of Cards I played with my camera and worked on my embroidery and repaired a button on his duvet cover for him. I took two photos of him on my new camera (my first photos ever on the camera!) and then after he was done watching his episodes we finished Moon. We were in such goofy moods because of the wine and funny conversations we‚Äôd had throughout the day, I was having so much fun. I took my make up off, brushed my teeth and hopped into bed where we were happy to know we‚Äôd get an extra hour of sleep because of daylight savings. We woke up and cuddled for a bit before rolling out of bed to make breakfast. He made us coffee (in the Chemex I bought him for his birthday, he loves it!) and then he made us waffles. We ate on the couch watching the office :) a great Sunday morning. I asked him if he still wanted to go downtown to see about this wood slab sale. We got dressed and headed out. I brought my camera just in case. Before we went home he asked if I wanted to go to the farmer‚Äôs market. I‚Äôm a red-blooded American girl so of course I said yes. We saw? SO MANY DOGS!!!! At least 70!!! This paragraph is dedicated to them. Some notable ones: 2 Westies, what looked like a miniature golden retriever wearing a blue bandana sleeping at the feet of his owner friend while he read a book and drank coffee outside, a fucking ginormous white dog that I can only describe as looking like Falkor from the Neverending Story named Yukon who was only 5 YEARS OLD but weighed 175lbs (so beautiful and I got to pet him and talk to his owner friend who was worried I would get my sweater furry by petting him and I was just like sir you don‚Äôt know me lol), a HUGE black dog that was probably Yukon‚Äôs friend, a golden retriever puppy who decided to lay down in the middle of the market because he was tired, a shaggy doggo sitting in a pile of leaves and then freaking out when he discovered a new leaf next to him, 3 huge german shepherds, 2 backpack dogs, one dog that was totally a human in another life that had similar-looking owner friends, a cocker-spaniel kind of dog whose owner friend let me take a photo of her and also give her a treat (her name was Maddy), an ancient golden retriever, an australian shepherd with his head in his owner friend‚Äôs lap because he was so pooped, and finally every other dog I saw because they‚Äôre all important. We walked around the farmer‚Äôs market for an hour or two. I have so much fun with my boyfriend. We have the same sense of humor and can communicate without saying anything to one another. We love people-watching and dog-watching together and today was a great day for that. It was a beautiful fall day! I took a lot of photos at the farmers market that I‚Äôll post here when I get them developed. At a certain point we both realized we were super hungry so we hit up No Bones, another favorite vegan spot. When I got there I was reminded of going there with Russell and how I made her steal the shark shot figurines and also how much I love those two. We ate lunch and then finally went home. I was so pooped! I was sad I to say goodbye to him and our lovely weekend together. I drove back to my apartment and realized how great the lighting was by the lake - I pulled over and took a couple of photos of the fall trees and the colors they offered. Once I got home, I took in how messy my apartment was and got to work. I put in a load of laundry, vacuumed, went through all my mail, took my recycling out, showered + deep conditioned my hair, put fresh sheets and a duvet cover on my bed, unloaded then reloaded the dishwasher, put all my clean clothes away, then watered my plants. I opened a new journal too that I‚Äôve set aside for my film camera - I‚Äôm keeping track of the dates I shot on which roll, locations I shot, and what kind of film I used. I love good documentation. :) Later on after relaxing for a bit, I went to the grocery store downstairs and got food for my lunches this week and then made dinner for myself and lit the candle my boyfriend got me in Portland last weekend on our excursion together. Currently watching Will & Grace with Joe and about to make some tea. This was so long but it was such a nice, cozy weekend and I didn‚Äôt want to forget any of it. I hope all of you had a chance to recharge and enjoy yourselves and your loved ones.

157105	Love	157105.jpg	üî¥üçÄ Always chew your food thoroughly, instead of just gulping it down. Chewing the food properly helps correct low stomach acid, and thus helps balance the pH level in your stomach. Chew your food 25 to 30 times before swallowing. Larger pieces of food are difficult to break down. Hence, the body produces more stomach acid to help digest the food. This, in turn, contributes to higher acid level in the body.

It‚Äôs waking up at 4am to him snoring and refraining from shoving him off the bed üòù. It‚Äôs talking in accents just for shits (Jamaican üáØüá≤), and trying to embarrass one another in public. It‚Äôs going on adventures and making fun of each other. It‚Äôs stupid fights and memorable makeups. Love isn‚Äôt just pretty and romantic.

167171	Love	167171.jpg	Delirium Inspired by the moments of deep dreams where the space enters abtraccion mode or basic graphics in which we are panic state to have no control of the suffering of the material transformation and culminates in contemplating movement of the entities Onirism or dream delirium Onirism is usually characterized by visual hallucinations, but may also be accompanied by those that involve the sense of touch and very rarely also includes auditory hallucinations. There are more complex combinations of onirism formed by hallucinations that involve several senses, which are called with the term ‚Äúdream delirium? Applied to Art It is worth mentioning that the term onirism can be seen and analyzed from an artistic perspective. In this way it can even be considered as a process of abstraction and synthesis, in which the artist is stimulated by reality, which he internalizes by choosing (arbitrarily or heuristically) certain details or events external to him or her, which he studies, remember, in some way he ponders or treasures them and finally reflects them in his work to share them with others. So we have that the artist uses and is used to interpret his dream or dream hallucinations, allusions, similes, metaphors, signs, and symbols. In specific cases: when words are used, then it is Literary Onirism; when images are used then it is Pictorial Onirism; when tangible forms (sculpture, jewelry, dance, ballet) are used, it is Plastic Onirism.
