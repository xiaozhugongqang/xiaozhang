641	Angry	641.jpg	I‚Äôm so frustrated right now that I‚Äôm not going to do anything but leave this right here with a few disclaimers and a side note. DISCLAIMER: the guy‚Äôs name and profile picture have been marked out for privacy purposes and because this isn‚Äôt about the person commenting, but about the culture and way of thinking he represents as a whole. DISCLAIMER: if any of my comments seem misandrist in any way, i apologize for that wasn‚Äôt my intention. I do not hate all men, nor do I believe that men are inherently evil and idiotic, however the culture and way of thinking he is representing (as described as ‚Äúshitty misogynistic fragile male ego?. That being said, I reiterate that I do not hate men and apologize if this comes across as misandrist. I have an older and a younger brother who I love very much and while they make women jokes, they‚Äôre open to men jokes and they treat, in my older brother‚Äôs case, his wife, and in my younger brother‚Äôs case, the girls he dates, with the utmost respect and they treat them the way they would like to be treated and while they align themselves with the traditional/biblical marriage (women are to be submissive and men are to lead), they still treat their significant others with respect and equality, and so seeing shit like this makes me angry because this is mistakenly tagged with men everywhere, including my brothers who are not like that. While it‚Äôs possible that my brothers agree with this list, if I were to ask them the first question I asked this guy, they would say ‚Äúnot at all, I would treat her the same?

65686	Fear	65686.jpg	üò®Fearüò® AKA Phobia, is the younger twin sister of Anxiety. She is very timid and gets scared easily. From insects to drowning, she is scared of them. Which is why she remains in her comfort barrier, which she calls her ‚ÄúSafe Bubble? When she hits Pure Form, her bubble pops and takes on a hideous form. So when I‚Äôm frighten‚Ä¶it gets VERY ugly. She tends to stutter and look around a lot, checking her surroundings. She sometimes trips and float away in her bubble, if not careful. She is based on ‚ÄúBubble Boy.?Her horns didn‚Äôt always look like that, she filed them down to prevent popping her own bubble. Sad made the bubble for her. And she smells like pure sweaty gym socks.	
66336	Fear	66336.jpg	Letter from Maureen Dowd to Mr. Trump 25 March 2017 WASHINGTON ?Dear Donald, We‚Äôve known each other a long time, so I think I can be blunt. You know how you said at campaign rallies that you did not like being identified as a politician? Don‚Äôt worry. No one will ever mistake you for a politician. After this past week, they won‚Äôt even mistake you for a top-notch negotiator. I was born here. The first image in my memory bank is the Capitol, all lit up at night. And my primary observation about Washington is this: Unless you‚Äôre careful, you end up turning into what you started out scorning. And you, Donald, are getting a reputation as a sucker. And worse, a sucker who is a tool of the D.C. establishment. Your whole campaign was mocking your rivals and the D.C. elite, jawing about how Americans had turned into losers, with our bad deals and open borders and the Obamacare ‚Äúdisaster.?And you were going to fly in on your gilded plane and fix all that in a snap. You mused that a good role model would be Ronald Reagan. As you saw it, Reagan was a big, good-looking guy with a famous pompadour; he had also been a Democrat and an entertainer. But Reagan had one key quality that you don‚Äôt have: He knew what he didn‚Äôt know. You both resembled Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day balloons, floating above the nitty-gritty and focusing on a few big thoughts. But President Reagan was confident enough to accept that he needed experts below, deftly maneuvering the strings. You‚Äôre just careering around on your own, crashing into buildings and losing altitude, growling at the cameras and spewing nasty conspiracy theories, instead of offering a sunny smile, bipartisanship, optimism and professionalism. You promised to get the best people around you in the White House, the best of the best. In fact, ‚Äúbest?is one of your favorite words. Instead, you dragged that motley skeleton crew into the White House and let them create a feuding, leaking, belligerent, conspiratorial, sycophantic atmosphere. Instead of a smooth, classy operator like James Baker, you have a Manichaean anarchist in Steve Bannon. You knew the Republicans were full of hot air. They haven‚Äôt had to pass anything in a long time, and they have no aptitude for governing. To paraphrase an old Barney Frank line, asking the Republicans to govern is like asking Frank to judge the Miss America contest ?‚ÄúIf your heart‚Äôs not in it, you don‚Äôt do a very good job.?You knew that Paul Ryan‚Äôs vaunted reputation as a policy wonk was fake news. Republicans have been running on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years and they never even bothered to come up with a valid alternative. And neither did you, despite all your promises to replace Obamacare with ‚Äúsomething terrific?because you wanted everyone to be covered. Instead, you sold the D.O.A. bill the Irish undertaker gave you as though it were a luxury condo, ignoring the fact that it was a cruel flimflam, a huge tax cut for the rich disguised as a health care bill. You were so concerned with the ‚Äúwin?that you forgot your ‚Äúforgotten?Americans, the older, poorer people in rural areas who would be hurt by the bill. As The Times‚Äôs chief Washington correspondent Carl Hulse put it, the G.O.P. falls into clover with a lock on the White House and both houses of Congress, and what‚Äôs the first thing it does? Slip on a banana peel. Incompetence Inc. ‚ÄúThey tried to sweeten the deal at the end by offering a more expensive bill with fewer health benefits, but alas, it wasn‚Äôt enough!?former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau slyly tweeted. Despite the best efforts of Bannon to act as though the whole fiasco was a clever way to bury Ryan ?a man he disdains as ‚Äúthe embodiment of the ‚Äòglobalist-corporatist?Republican elite,?as Gabriel Sherman put it in New York magazine ?it won‚Äôt work. And you can jump on the phone with The Times‚Äôs Maggie Haberman and The Washington Post‚Äôs Robert Costa ?ignoring that you‚Äôve labeled them the ‚Äúfake media??and act like you‚Äôre in control. You can say that people should have waited for ‚ÄúPhase 2?and ‚ÄúPhase 3??whatever they would have been ?and that Obamacare is going to explode and that the Democrats are going to get the blame. But it doesn‚Äôt work that way. You own it now. You‚Äôre all about flashy marketing so you didn‚Äôt notice that the bill was junk, so lame that even Republicans skittered away. You were humiliated right out of the chute by the establishment guys who hooked you into their agenda ?a massive transfer of wealth to rich people ?and drew you away from your own. You sold yourself as the businessman who could shake things up and make Washington work again. Instead, you got worked over by the Republican leadership and the business community, who set you up to do their bidding. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre putting up with all your craziness about Russia and wiretapping and unending lies and rattling our allies. They‚Äôre counting on you being a delusional dupe who didn‚Äôt even know what was in the bill because you‚Äôre sitting around in a bathrobe getting your information from wackadoodles on Fox News and then, as The Post reported, peppering aides with the query, ‚ÄúIs this really a good bill??You got played. It took W. years to smash everything. You‚Äôre way ahead of schedule. And I can say you‚Äôre doing badly, because I‚Äôm a columnist, and you‚Äôre not. Say hello to everybody, O.K.?

73811	Fear	73811.jpg	What Predicts Distress After Episodes of Sleep Paralysis? Ever find yourself briefly paralyzed as you‚Äôre falling asleep or just waking up? It‚Äôs a phenomenon is called sleep paralysis, and it‚Äôs often accompanied by vivid sensory or perceptual experiences, which can include complex and disturbing hallucinations and intense fear. For some people, sleep paralysis is a once-in-a-lifetime experience; for others, it can be a frequent, even nightly, phenomenon. Researchers James Allan Cheyne and Gordon Pennycook of the University of Waterloo in Canada explore the factors associated with distress after sleep paralysis episodes in a new article published in Clinical Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. The researchers used an online survey and follow-up emails to survey 293 people. They measured post-episode distress using a range of items, from post-episode rumination to interference with next-day functioning. The level of distress following sleep paralysis episodes was associated with features of the sleep paralysis episode itself. For example, the results showed that the more fear people felt during sleep paralysis episodes, the more distress they felt afterward. The researchers also found that sensory experiences during episodes of sleep paralysis predicted later distress. Feelings of threat and assault ?such as sensing a presence in the room, feeling pressure on the chest, having difficulty breathing, or having a feeling of imminent death ?were all associated with distress following sleep paralysis episodes. So, too, were vestibular-motor experiences, including feelings of floating or falling and out-of-body experiences. Cheyne and Pennycook speculate that the sensory experiences that come with episodes of sleep paralysis could exacerbate people‚Äôs fear, creating a feedback loop that enhances memories of experiences later on. Post-episode distress was also associated with a number of individual-level factors, including cognitive style, distress sensitivity, and supernatural beliefs about sleep paralysis. People who held supernatural beliefs about sleep paralysis experiences also experienced greater post-episode distress. Those who had more analytic cognitive styles, on the other hand, experienced comparatively less distress after sleep paralysis episodes. Taken together, these findings show that both situational factors and individual factors contribute to these common, and often stressful, personal experiences. These findings are important, the researchers say, because they provide insight into a common experience of distress that is not well understood. Some participants lamented that their experiences of terror following episodes of sleep paralysis were often dismissed by clinicians. Given that a large percentage of people report some carryover effects on their functioning the next day, sleep paralysis could ‚Äúmake a significant contribution to the billions of dollars, worldwide, in costs associated with accidents, illnesses, and lost productivity associated with sleep disturbances,?the researchers note.

But most of us? Don‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt have weapons or girth or anything good to use against our attacker/s. And when that happens, unless you are SUPREMELY lucky,fighting back will earn you additional injuries. When I tried to fight of MY rapist, despite being heavily drugged and barely conscious - and even though she knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to actually fight back, she stepped on my thigh, punched me in the stomach, grabbed both my wrists and slammed them against the roots of the tree we‚Äôd stopped at in the woods until I started crying and swearing I‚Äôd stop fighting her. So fuck this. Fight back IF YOU ARE ABLE. My best friend got fucking SHIVVED because he cried for help. My sister was black and blue for weeks after her ex-boyfriend tried to take her in an empty classroom after class, and she‚Äôs one of the lucky ones who got away. So yeah; if you have the means to defend yourself or someone else, DO DO SO. But if you‚Äôre like me? Like my best friend? Don‚Äôt do it. It sounds horrible, but don‚Äôt add bullet/stab/slicing wounds, bruises, broken bones, etc. to an already unendurable horror.

83023	Fear	83023.jpg	Meet Ferguson Moreau. He‚Äôs 24 years old and kind of looks like Keiynan Lonsdale. He is an Art Imagineer Trainee at Disney. He‚Äôs open. ?His Past Both of Ferguson‚Äôs parents were renowned scientists and treated most of his childhood and homeschooling as ongoing experiments. He knew his parents loved him, but being put through different controlled environments didn‚Äôt really prepare him for the world out there. Not that he ever saw the world through rose colored glasses, more often than not, every single scenario in his daily life always went awry. Ferg couldn‚Äôt really pour himself a glass of milk without fearing it had already gone bad. As he grew up and longed to actually experiment the world outside from the bubble his parents had created, Ferguson found himself letting his imagination go wild in the journals that were meant for him to catalogue his thoughts. Although his exposure to comics and cartoons was limited, he still was so enamoured by them that he started to create his own; his favorite was about an indestructible boy that flew all around the world helping people with their issues. Strangely enough, his parents ended up applauding his talent; after a while they understood they could support him more. He grew up a smart but fearful child, and he only realized what had truly gone wrong with him when he finally attended Walt for high school. He was unable to fully interact with his classmates and most found his hypochondriatic tendencies to be a laughing matter. His saving grace came in the form of the Art Club, where not only he managed to make a couple of friends, but created a portfolio that would end up getting him his dream job just after graduation. ?His Present Long story short, it took him a while to get used to the chaos of the outside world and he still finds himself biting his nails down to the bone. Ferg is about to reach the two year mark in his job and he fears that, even though in his head it makes perfect sense but at the same time it doesn‚Äôt, he might get fired at any moment. His coworkers and boss know he‚Äôs a talented young man that could go great lengths if he only put himself and his ideas out there; he‚Äôs making an effort, but it‚Äôs not enough that he‚Äôs currently being recognized for it. ?His Personality Ferg describes himself as a yarn of nervousness that has been thrown into a world of needles. He‚Äôs the kind of person that you want on your side if you need to make a pro and con list, if you‚Äôre willing to sit through a lengthy ramble with little to no pauses in the middle. It‚Äôs not as if he‚Äôs entirely content being the voice of pessimistic reason among his peers, but he‚Äôs incapable of taking anything good for granted. Ferguson, though amazingly talented, will always need a little push in the right direction when it comes to showing up his newest sketches or being able to hold both his head and hand up high when he‚Äôs got an idea in mind. For the most part, he tries to be nice to whomever he encounters because he doesn‚Äôt know whether or not they‚Äôre having a bad day; he does this knowing he‚Äôd like for all the other people to be the same way. ?His Qualities + Loyal, Empathetic, Generous - Paranoid, Restive, Pusillanimous ?His Relationships Anthony Keller (Best Friend): Growing up an only child made Ferg believe he would never have a fraternal connection to anyone, Tony proved him wrong. He‚Äôs grateful the guy has never been the kind of ‚Äúfriend?that has tried to change his personality or toughen him up. Perrie Sparks (Acquaintance): Ferg finds the girl incredibly sweet and wants to get to know her more. Perrie‚Äôs always kind to him and he‚Äôs intrigued about how much she knows and can talk about. Steven Pelekai (Fears): The boisterous guy has sent Ferguson into hiding; he still has war flashbacks to that one party where Stitch pushed him off the balcony of a house and right into the pool two stories below.

83702	Fear	83702.jpg	TOBIAS WADE ?51 SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ?2017 Fifty-one does not have the ambition of one-thousand-and-one but in a way, it seems to be the same project except that the size of the stories may vary a lot from two pages to twenty. They all are united by some element of fear and horror, at times fright and terror, but the themes are changing a lot with some kind of a pattern. Let‚Äôs take some examples. These stories are centered on characters who have something negative going on with their family circle when they have one, with themselves all the time especially when they are alone, and they are often alone, with their inner self as opposed to their outer self, and often their inner self takes its own life in its own hands and then the character is doubled-up and each half is autonomous with the ex-inner self taking over and creating some kind of havoc. Don‚Äôt believe this author does not know his horror classics and particularly the rule Stephen King suggested a long time ago: a horror author has to try to horrify his audience at first. If he can‚Äôt then he can try to terrify his audience. And if he can‚Äôt even do that he can try to gross out his audience. The author here, like Stephen King, uses the three options in the book, but most of the time each story only has one dimension. Gross-out is common, terror is more difficult to reach and horror is a reward to the patient reader. Gross-out is for me best represented by the story ‚ÄúUnborn Doll?in which a deranged teenage mother reveals her derangement is her pregnancy, and her family does not help who wants to get the child away, hence to abort it. The child has no father at all, never mentioned. The pregnant mother and later teenage mother has a mother and a father and both are absolutely hostile to her. The teenage mother will deliver a stillborn child that she will keep with her, dress up, pamper with makeup now and then perfume to cover up the rotting smell and the punchline is the most disgusting idea a mother can have: to sew up the mouth of this baby that cries at night. That punchline punches your good taste right in its stomach and down to its heels. But it reveals something. It seems to express the fright of society in front of such teenage pregnancies and at the same time their desire to solve the problem with stillborn babies for all of them, not abortion but a God-given or nature-provided form of abortion, but then all these mothers would get berserk and would have to be locked up sooner or later. That‚Äôs the worst part of it. And that grosses you out completely and you are then terrified because in real politics some may actually think of that as a solution to teenage pregnancies: stillborn births and the commitment of the mothers after birth. In the same line, we could quote ‚ÄúConfessions of a Serial Killer?that explains how a father confessed, out of love for his daughter, having committed a long series of crimes perpetrated by his daughter. He is in prison probably under a death penalty sentence. He writes his confessions to his daughter and the letter is captured and confiscated when it was attempted to deliver it out of the prison. We learn from the cop taking care of the case that the daughter has disappeared. The crime of this daughter was a serial killing of young children. She captured them one by one and one after the other. She tortured them one after the other and one at a time and the main torture was to starve them to death or nearly so that the next one captured will have to eat what is still available on the body of the previous one who is not necessarily completely dead. Once again that is grossness more than terror. And that daughter is still running free. The story reveals once again there is a strange desire in girls, the future life giving mothers. They want to capture children and torture them to death through hunger and cannibalism to punish them for having been born and having become a burden to their mothers, to women enslaved by that phenomenon. You find this theme of the enslaved mother over and over again. The story ‚ÄúVicarious?deals with a father but this time in his relation to his son. The story has a pattern. The father is too harsh with his son; too ambitious as for what he wants his son to accomplish; too reckless about his son and letting him try anything he wants with his bike; too self-satisfied with the son he produces with his own attitude and the good result he gets in his competition. Until one day it goes berserk when the son fails to get a victory. The son will go back to training, even harder and more recklessly, until one day there will be an accident. A big bad great fall into a ravine and like Humpty Dumpty the son is killed and yet a supernatural doppelganger survives who will take the full control of the father by satisfying the father‚Äôs desire for the son to get victories. The pattern then is clear: to replace the ‚Äúdead?son with some creature from hell who takes the son‚Äôs body and deemed the son to be and stay in hell. Like that there is no hope and the father lives in terror since this fake son will be able to get from him anything for him not to be obliged to admit publicly that his son is dead, and how could he prove and explain it? Till, with no explanation, the sun comes back one day as a monster from hell and saves the situation: he expels the fake son and he himself goes back to hell to fight against these demons, Irosancts, who take over dead people to have a second life in the world. Their name is pure Latin, maybe, and may mean the saints born from angry greed if not greedy anger, stepping directly out from the medieval book of Christian exorcism. How many fathers do this mistake of projecting their dreams into their sons? It fails most of the time and then the sons are forced by this failure to do what they, the sons, want to do, or rather what the circumstances the sons are in make them do, and that is not always very nice. Though there is one gram of hope here since this son back from the dead saves the father he should hate to the last minute of his eternal damnation. That‚Äôs the softening touch: supernatural, like a famous TV series, but in a mild version. The Winchester brothers would have destroyed the real son too since he is a monster from hell too: two monster-killing brothers destroying two monstrous brothers. Whoa! The last example I will consider is ‚ÄúVirtual Terror.?It is the story of two brothers. One went to Afghanistan where he did bad things in his military missions. One day he questioned a man and tortured him to get the information he wanted by torturing the man‚Äôs son in front of him of course. No details possible here. In the end, he will get some information, good or bad does not matter, and the man and his son will be of course executed, disposed of like some waste. Torturing is a game as is well-known, a game with humans who have to be alive and it is all the more joyful if they are reactive in that lively game of torture. But this soldier ends badly due to an accident and he is in a wheel chair paralyzed the waist up. God‚Äôs punishment if you want. His brother takes him to a Virtual Reality arcade and he has an adventure that ends badly, again. He has a fit of some epilepsy or whatever and he is taken back to his home by his brother. He tries to kill himself with some firearm but his brother intervenes and it is the brother who is killed. Then the paralyzed ex-soldier tries to kill himself again and only wounds his mouth and jaw without exploding his brain. He ends up in hospital with his father sneering at him with contempt and agony. We are in a dual world again (and this duality is a pattern). First the two brothers, then the father and the surviving paralyzed brother. Contempt from the father, self-contempt from the paralyzed brother, fatherly love agony for the father and self-hate agony for the paralyzed brother. And finally the realization that hope and fear are the same thing. One hopes for something and that something is the source of one‚Äôs fear. Hope leads to fear, nourishes fear, nurtures fear, gives birth to fear. The story crystallizes the American drama. The post-Afghanistan-Iraq fear in 2008 brought hope to the White House, but this hope was partly dissatisfied, betrayed some say, and it gave birth to fear, nurtured that fear to the point of bringing the most fearful and fear-mongering nightmare to the same White House. Is the world condemned to live in that dual vision? To be dismembered between oneself and a second ‚Äúbrother?or ‚Äúvirtual image?of ourselves? Between fear and hope? And yet the two are only one, the two sides of the same coin. God and his spirit on one side, and the absolutely unitary god on the other side. Judaism (Genesis 1:1-2) and Islam, with a vague Christian ternary pattern: father, son1, and son2, but either captured in a succession of two dualities or in a perverse ternary situation of torture. Torturer T torturing a man‚Äôs son S to make the father F speak. Binary couple: T ?S Binary couple: T ?F Binary couple: S ?F Note how this situation makes the torturing soldier be the Holy Spirit to fulfill the Christian Trinity: The Father F, the son S and the holy spirit T. This perversion of this sanctified Trinity is speaking to the reader so much that it could even become a haunting element. This ternary pattern is always in the background, never central. The man and the devil speaking to the man in his head are the central elements. The man on the VR game-machine and the Japanese operator that more or less accompany him in his playing are central (Is the machine the ternary element? Then the Holy Spirit is not much if it is the machine, but if the machine is the Father, then the Japanese operator is the Holy Spirit, quite a surprising suggestion for a Buddhist and Zen character). The man and hope-fear concentrated in the VR helmet are the central elements. Are we condemned to live within this dual fake choice that leads to nothing except the perpetuity of the present survival instinct in which any ternary element is only one element used to pressurize another element in a triad because of the dual link between this element and the ternary element, the way I have explained for the torture situation? To conclude I feel like saying this ternary torturing image of three binary relations that are the sides of a triangle of evil is the pattern of modern schizophrenia. We can just wonder if that is not a prediction about the future of the White House in the present more circumstantial than historical situation? Is Tobias Wade the prophet of a new age? We could believe that since Tobias-Tobit is a rather important (tough at times evanescent) character in the Old Testament as is clearly said in the following reference: ‚ÄúThe Book of Tobias, as it is called in the Latin Vulgate, is also known in the Greek Septuagint as the Book of Tobit, and serves as part of the Historical Books in the Latin Vulgate and Greek Septuagint Bible. Both the Hebrew origin of the book and the name Tobiah which means ‚ÄúYahweh is my good?have been appreciated since antiquity ?The recent discovery of five scrolls of Tobit - 4QTob 196-200 in both Aramaic and Hebrew among the Dead Sea Scrolls in Cave IV of Qumran has given the book renewed attention. As with all ancient texts discovered in the Dead Sea Scrolls, Hebrew was in consonantal form only. The Book of Tobit is also extant in Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Syriac.?( And this Tobias Wade embodies the following prayer uttered by Tobias in his story: ? And now, O Lord, think of me, and take not revenge of my sins, neither remember my offenses, nor those of my parents. 4 For we have not obeyed thy commandments, therefore are we delivered to spoil and to captivity, and death, and are made a fable, and a reproach to all nations, amongst which thou hast scattered us. 5 And now, O Lord, great are thy judgments, because we have not done according to thy precepts, and have not walked sincerely before thee: 6 And now, O Lord, do with me according to thy will, and command my spirit to be received in peace: for it is better for me to die, than to live.?(The Book of Tobit or Tobias, 3:3-6) Hope is definitely not the main quality of this life. But fear is definitely the best element of this book. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU

Do you not believe that there is nothing too big or too small that He doesn‚Äôt want to be informed about? You have nothing to fear but God himself and even then upon repentance and asking for forgiveness, His grace won‚Äôt allow you to experience the full blow of the consequences of your sins.

As I was called to honour my powers and use them for my sisters, this awakening began a new chapter in my life. This was Ayja. As inspiration from other feminine energies heightened within me, this feeling of boundless power flew through me. I came to realise the importance and strength we hold as women, and felt as though this needed to be unveiled to us all.This is how the Goddess Ayja was born. Her birthing was founded by the balance of love and nature, a balance all women should consciously connect to. So on this journey you will be receiving many things from Ayja. She will tell you to utilise your healing powers, by filling the place in your heart that longs for regaining the spirit and powers of the sacred feminine. She will tell you that your sisters are your best friends, and we are to use our magnetic energy as a collective. She will tell you to keep a close and strong connection to nature, as this is our true source of power. We are unable to work in nurturing and healing without it. She will tell you to always follow your intuition, whatever feelings are hiding in our hearts needs to be brought out and activated. A focus on the true depth of ~ self love ~ a meaning that has been forgotten and misunderstood over time. Lost in the universe we live in, our aim is to reconnect with this soul hugging term. We will explore self love on this journey, through all handmade gifts created with love, and through a space of acceptance and appreciation. www.ayjalove.com Beautiful artwork by: Deziree Lovas

161812	Love	161812.jpg	Star ruby a perfect gift for someone you love. It heel the power of love It is 6.85CT cabochon and the dimension of it is 9√ó11√ó7 MM. Starting bid is 55.15$ and shipping charge is 7$. Tag the person whom üëáüëáyou bid more with 1$ more. An asteriated variety of ruby with normally six chatoyant rays are known as Star Ruby. It does not occur in complete transparency, because the star can only be produced by the presence of needle like inclusions. Star rubies are very valuable. The most remarkable observable fact of rubies is the development of the six ray star, arranged in perfect symmetry. When the stone is moved, it shifts its centre and is clearly visible under a single light source such as the sun or a lamp. In multiple light sources many stars are seen. Each light produces its own star, which is basically a reflection. The effect is usually less pronounced in more transparent stones. When the base colour is ruby red it is known as Star Ruby. This stone increases the internal strength and reduces tensions. Star Ruby eliminates stress related problems like Migraine, Insomnia, and Hysteria etc. Traditionally it is worn by warrior in the battlefields to protect themselves from the enemy. #

The pain is always going to be felt, the tinge in your body when he runs his hands down your side or holds your hips, he isn‚Äôt you and he isn‚Äôt even close to being you.

It hasn‚Äôt stopped hurting, it hasn‚Äôt lessened, all the things they said tome will fix, have not changed and I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can handle. I‚Äôm exhausted.
