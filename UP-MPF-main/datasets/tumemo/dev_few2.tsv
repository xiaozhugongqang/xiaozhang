66604	Fear	66604.jpg	Why Haunted Houses Creep Us Out From a psychological point of view, the standard features of haunted houses trigger feelings of dread because they push buttons in our brains that evolved long before houses even existed. These alarm buttons warn us of potential danger and motivate us to proceed with caution. Haunted houses give us the creeps not because they pose a clear threat to us, but rather because it is unclear whether or not they represent a threat. This ambivalence leaves you frozen in place, wallowing in unease.	
66658	Fear	66658.jpg	<!-- more --> 3 am - you text me asking if I’m up 5 am - I reply saying “kinda? ? you reply saying, “Nevermind. Go back to sleep.? Naturally, I went back to sleep, thinking you were just tired & needed someone to talk to on your way home. When you texted me saying “nevermind,?I just thought you no longer needed to talk, that you safely made it home, that you were quietly going back to sleep. 10 am - I text asking what was going on. ? you reply saying you ran off the road. Thought: Okay, he swerved on the shoulder a little Reality: You ran off the road in a ditch Thought: Okay, a small ditch. Reality: You climbed for 10 minutes on hands & knees out the “ditch?in the freezing rain. You hydroplaned off the interstate & spun out of control, damn near into a lake (though you say the lake was on the other side). Thank God you were okay! A million thoughts ran through my head. Immediately, I wanted to cry, but I had to stay strong for you. I had to make sure you were okay. You were. Yesterday, my biggest fear came true: something happening to you on the road. Thank God: He kept you safe. He wrapped you in His hands & took complete control. Material things were destroyed, but my baby, my heart, my other half, was safe. One of my biggest fears is losing you. It’s hard that it came so close. I can’t sleep. I’m worried about your safety. I can’t breathe. What can I do? Can I keep you in a bubble? I can’t protect you all the time. This is out of my control. Every night, I hit my knees and pray for your safety. And every time, God comes through. You came by that evening. The first thing I should’ve done was hugged you. I should’ve wrapped you in my arms & held on tight. I froze. Vulnerability and emotions + me = don’t mix. I should’ve held you. I should’ve told you it was going to be okay. At that moment, you needed me. Why couldn’t I come through? I want to hug you right now. I want to see you. I want a redo. I want to cry. You’re my other half, my best friend. I can’t lose you. I love you so much. I couldn’t protect you. I feel helpless. I feel lost.	
66737	Fear	66737.jpg	I died. But, in a moment, I seemed to reconnect to every nerve, and became aware of every sensation - moreso than I ever was in life. I perceived myself trapped within an immovable object, and the intensity of the struggle amplified: subtle, then acute, then racking. I cannot describe it completely - but imagine holding your breath, beyond urge, beyond pain, beyond desperation - head throbbing and eyes bulging - a dream of suffocation without end. My skin blistered and split in the sunlight; biting insects descended rapidly. I felt eggs hatch, larvae crawl, gases build and burst within me, individual cells rupturing, interstitial fluids souring and blackening. Somehow my capacity to experience and store these sensations grew - even as I was keenly aware of my cerebrum being scattered and devoured, my perception expanded, into the gizzards of birds and the depths of fire ant dens. I was aware of every fingernail and strand of hair that pulled away in the wind - and my sensation clung to them as they settled in the ocean and dissolved in the maws of a trillion diatoms. I don’t understand it. The more bits of me there were, the larger my capacity for the perception of pain. As I decayed into pieces smaller than living nerves could possibly distinguish, the character of the discomfort changed - from burning and aching and breaking I might relate to you in human terms - to something worse that I cannot fully articulate: a terrible, maddening stretching of every part of myself from every other part. Humans often numb to chronic pains in life, do they not? Yet every year, every month, every second that passed - I swear it only intensified over time. In my previous life, I ruminated on Heaven and Hell, and the likelihood of my experiencing one, the other, or something in between. As terrible as I imagined the torpor of Heaven or the torments of Hell to be, this was entirely different from either. In Hell, at least, there would surely be a tormentor, some memory of my deeds, some sense of justice, even if my soul rejected its logic. I can imagine some comfort in Hell, for a mind such as mine. I do not think this is a punishment. I do not think it is caused. I deeply suspect it is simply our condition, our nature to go on this way, do you see? In all that time, I was certainly, absolutely, totally alone, and before long all memory of life had shriveled to a cinder, lost beneath my interminable anguish. Alive again, I suspect I cannot quite recall the worst of it - as if my living brain is too small for the experience.I was dead for eighteen years, and my misery eludes description. Dare we try to fathom the collective agony of legions of ancient dead? Believe this: I will not return to that execrable existence. Not a hundred years from now, not ever. Anything is better, so long as it is forever.

69165	Fear	69165.jpg	Matthew 6:25b-34 ~ “…do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore do not worry, saying, ’What shall we eat??or ‘What shall we wear??For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.? ————————————————————————————————? There is more to life than fame. There is more to life than power. There is more to life than money.

As much as I want to think it’s over and done with I know people still have hate in their hearts towards African American’s and that is what I think about everyday as an African American female? I think about hate and if it’s truly gone, I think about racism and how it comes out when people are mad, I think about all the TV shows that use racism as comedy, Overall my mind is forever rolling with thoughts and why wouldn’t it, it’s my history.

77981	Fear	77981.jpg	Hold me tight when ascending Did you know Momo the hedgehog felt more awkward (more stressed maybe?) when ascending than descending? Case-study Evidence? Experiment While Momo’s eyes being open ascending at 30cm/second on my hand, her corrugators (the muscles above eyes) instinctively contracted. It might signal, ?I am scared! Let me close the eyes first so that they couldn’t see.? Experiment While her eyes being open descending at the same speed, her corrugators were relatively relaxed comparing with those in Exp. It might signal, : “Well, what are you doing? I am not scared.? Experiment While covering Momo’s eyes by my left hand and ascending at the same speed on my right, surprisingly the same result as Exp. Why? What do I say? My explanation is that these animals are innately ready to roll in a ball while experiencing something like a free fall to self defense from the point of final impact. Cushion, right? However, while ascending, they may not know what to do with their body, except covering their eyes. Contracting eye muscles are an automatic self-defense presentation of hedgehogs anyway. What make it meaningful (or significant) in terms of fears dealing with ascending versus descending? Implication? The stress generated by sudden environmental ascendance may associate with hedgehog’s vision. Because hedgehog’s vision is relatively poor and greatly sensitive to movements, Momo’s fear of the ascendance might be more likely initiated by visible changes, whilst fear of sudden environmental descendance, such as free fall, more likely geographic. Such presentation and effect need to be elucidated by future observations and a greater sample size. P.S. Let me know your observations-if any. I don’t think anyone would be interested in what I say in this blog, but it’s worth-noting some cautions below - just in case.

They were special because for a year before that I hadn’t left my house. Then one day I decided, if I’m going to leave my house, I’m going to do it in a big way. So I left the country. It was both horrible and the best thing I could do. I finally got over my fear of leaving my house.

84680	Fear	84680.jpg	Everything And Nothing by FreeByNature Indecisive. Moody. It’s complicated. Sometimes even when it feels like you have so much, you feel empty. Sometimes you want to create but you’re afraid to try, afraid to fail. You love the praise. Is that a bad thing? If we got no praise, would we still create? Do we really love it as much as we think we do? You love the praise. But how do you follow a previous success? You don’t even have any idea what you want to do. That spark, that inspiration, just can’t be forced. It comes and goes as it pleases. We’re supposed to practice everyday. But some days the motivation isn’t there. The idea isn’t there. But fear is there. Reluctance is there. Every new work is a new challenge. Not everybody enjoys charging into a new challenge, like adrenaline junkies. Not everyone is so thrilled to work, and that’s not even considering the reality of having to compete with others. But that’s not just art. That’s life in general. It’s scary. It makes you want to cry sometimes; why can’t it just be easier? So many of us love the reward, but dread the work that we have to do to be rewarded. It’s scary sometimes. There is however an encouraging saying that goes something like this: “If you try to be 100% better every day, you’ll fail by the end of the year. If you try to be 1% better every day, you’ll be better by the end of the year. Have patience. Take small steps. Give it time.?~ bmviiofyva

I started working two jobs and I end up working all day everyday and go home exhausted. I don’t have time to write or draw and I try my best to make time for my friends and family. Well this last weekend my friends took me up to their cabin in New Mexico and I had the best weekend of my life. I’ve missed the mountains so much and our days were spent exploring trails and seeing some really cool animals. This thanksgiving I just want to remind everyone that even when you want to give up you’ve always got someone that cares about you and has your back. Thank you to my best friends Amy, Chase, and Domingo. I don’t know what I would do without you guys.

The pineapple is her. The Pokémon was the cartoon the kids were always watching growing up and Jurassic Park was the movie I remember watching the most with my son and daughter. No matter how big they will always be my little girl and boy and I will love them forever. (at Wentzville, Missouri)

Nature created the now familiar backdrop of hills, lake and grassy pastures, but a visionary film director, Tolkien, innovative designers and a dedicated team of landscapers, along with large portions of Kiwi farming ‘wire?with a can-do philosophy have provided the rest.

169917	Love	169917.jpg	Stressed = dessertS Kind of corny, however I was talking to a friend last night and realized the connection to these two words. The spelling of stressed, reversed is desserts. It is sweat that they both have differnet meanings and yet, they work together. Being stressed may not seem good at times, however stress is an internal enotion that kick starts off so much in our bodies. Out blood rushes, our breathing increase, so much is happening to creat a healing for what is coming. Kind of sweet, like desserts. Continual stress can eventually catch up with us and hurt us. Understanding the sweet side of stress of becoming stronger, learning from our reactions, we realize we become better at who we are and can get through anything. So stressed becomes the desserts as we know we have moved through tough things in the past. So remeber, when you are stressed, remember the sweet sid eof it and enjoy your dessert, or victory if getting through it. My book, can help you push through these times maing it easy to push through. www.gilevansbooks.com (at Huron Lightship Historical Marker)
