1645	Angry	1645.jpg	Hanging with Hulk (Mostly) After all the smashing is done sometimes Hulk doesn‚Äôt immediately want to give Banner back so someone usually hangs with him until he calms down to reduce post-battle collateral damage. Tony is best at containing Hulk but can be easily distracted from his duties. Clint has been mostly banned from this as he ‚Äòaccidentally?encourages shenanigans in the name of 'the possibilities? At least with Thor the damage is fairly localized. Hulk isn‚Äôt exactly 'good with authority?but Steve can usually get the job done. Natasha is still better at Bruce-duty. It‚Äôs a work in progress.

I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs supposed to be funny. Even as a joke ‚Äúgo back to the kitchen?or ‚Äúmake me a sandwich?humor is over done and boring, no longer even surprising to those of us who have heard it again and again. ‚ÄúHur I‚Äôm so cool, I dismiss women and then order them to do my bidding.?because that‚Äôs so funny.

11089	Angry	11089.jpg	New Post has been published on Why Its Seriously Dangerous To Exercise Angry (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(); Many of us struck the health club to allow off heavy steam. Yet brand-new study recommends that if you‚Äôre upset or dismayed, you might intend to relax prior to doing an extreme exercise. A brand-new Canadian research study has actually located that integrating hefty physical effort with a stressed out or distressed mood places you at virtually a 3 times a better danger of a cardiovascular disease. The research from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. was released in the journal Circulation on Monday, as well as assessed information from 12,461 individuals experiencing a very first cardiovascular disease in 52 nations. After their cardiovascular disease, individuals were asked if they would certainly taken part in hefty physical effort and/or if they had actually been mad or mentally disturbed in the hr prior to their signs started. Scientists located that hefty physical effort paired with a severe emotion greater than tripled the danger of having a cardiovascular disease. The research regulated for a variety of variables, consisting of individuals?smoking cigarettes condition, body mass index, high blood pressure degrees, heart-related drugs, sex as well as age ?the writers located no substantial distinction in between age (under 45, 45 to 65, or over 65) or in between males and females. Barry J. Jacobs, supervisor of behavior scientific researches at the Crozer-Keystone Family Medicine Residency Program in Springfield, Pennsylvania, claims the research (which he was not associated with) supplies more proof of the web link in between body and mind. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre upset, that‚Äôs not the moment to head out as well as cut a pile of timber,?stated Jacobs. ‚ÄúAll of us need to exercise psychological health as well as prevent shedding our mood to extremes.? Routine workout, obviously, is incredibly helpful for you. It avoids tension, heart problem as well as a variety of various other disorders. The most significant issue is that the majority of us do not obtain sufficient of it. For very psychological people with a high danger of cardiac arrest, the consolidation of yoga exercise?with its concentrate on breathing, reflection and also leisure ?may be specifically useful. Team workout courses in a social setup might likewise fend off sensations of severe temper. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push();

81637	Fear	81637.jpg	A BAO A QU I saw him waiting there. Prince Charming, waiting at the bottom of the stairs, ready to meet his true love. All he had to do was climb. I sat on the first step, too eager, forgetting myself for a moment and nearly latching myself onto the poor boy. It had been quite a while since I had fed. My many tentacles scuttled in anticipation, creating an ominous tapping sound that the boy could not hear. He took one breath and finally, finally, he started up the stairs. He was more muscly than his predecessor, perhaps he could last through it all. I needed him to succeed in this quest. It was the only way for me to be truly satisfied. My hunger had overcome me far too often these days. I had caught myself about to jump from the bottom step more than ten times. Even knowing that leaving the last step meant certain death, my body wished for it. My mind did not. The boy had defeated the other two curses that the witch had placed on this tower. He killed the troll that guarded the drawbridge. He had slain the dragon that lay below in the dungeons. Now all he needed to do was defeat the final curse. Me. The natives refer to me as A Bao A Qu, meaning soul sucker. I can‚Äôt help it. I have always been hungry, and there is no other way for me to eat. With each step he climbs, I feed more and more. I feel tears on my face, tears of relief, tears of finally feeling satisfaction. My hunger no longer burns within me. It is subdued, for now. I try to slow down, but I find myself gorging on him, filling myself quickly, weakening him. I see now that he will not succeed. I have taken too much from him. His skin has paled, his eyes hollowed, his will diminished. I regret it immediately. He stops, slumps against the steps, eyes unseeing. He is dead. You fucking idiot, I berate myself.

192692	Sad	192692.jpg	Romeo x juliet Type: romance, drama fantasy You propably have read it already somewhere the great but sad Romeo & juliette story watched passionately the american film or put efforts into getting shakespear s detailed words however japan s animation gave the story nearly a completely different plot & conclusions How s that ? a lot happened a lot changed but the ill fated couple had to be from a mosquerade of justice until a dethroned leader then a deseperate lover who s trying to save the beloved city & it s people If I had to nominate the fun parts about this anime it d be first the great opening the touching romance moments the new version of the strong juliet in action and finally the creative plot that got me attached all the way

194924	Sad	194924.jpg	5AM How are you, my friend? I told you I was just like you. I also wanted to end it all. I wanted to kill myself, too. Now, here I am ?telling you not to do it. I learned a lot from life. I learned a lot from staying alive. Trust me when I say, you will one day experience joy that matches this pain. You will cry euphoric tears from the stupid jokes of your friends, you will stare down at the face of a baby as she lies asleep in your lap and you will know the beauty of life, you will make great friends, you will eat delicious food you haven‚Äôt tried yet, you will be able to look at a view from a high place and not assess the likelihood of dying from falling. There are books you haven‚Äôt read yet that will enrich you, films you will watch while eating extra-large buckets of popcorn, and you will dance and laugh and have sex and go for runs by the river and have late-night conversations and laugh until it hurts. Life is waiting for you. You might be stuck here for a while, but the world isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Hang on in there if you can. Life is always worth it. Stay hopeful.
